Getting Started 
===============

**Intro :**

Proper environment management is crucial in complex projects involving multiple languages, 
libraries, and frameworks. Thankfully, various tools have been created to address this, including Conda, 
Virtual Environments, Containers, and Pip. 

**Purpose :**

The main purpose of using these tools is to ensure that the dependencies for one project don’t 
interfere with another. This is especially critical in complex AI/ML projects, where multiple libraries, 
frameworks, and languages may be used. The tools provide isolation, which helps avoid conflicts and 
ensures consistency across different development and production environments. 

**Objectives :**

* **Educate** users about the pros and cons of different tools: virtual environments, Conda, and containers.
* **Optimize** AI/ML workflows by leveraging TACC’s high-performance hardware like GPUs, ensuring efficient use of resources.
* **Provide** actionable instructions for building these environments with a focus on ease of use and compatibility with TACC machines
