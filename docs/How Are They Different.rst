How They Are Different
======================

Each of these tools serves a distinct purpose, with specific use cases tailored to different needs in a project. While they can often be used together, each tool excels in a particular area of development or deployment.


Conda vs Virtual Environments
-----------------------------
* **Conda:** More versatile since it manages both environments and packages, not just for Python but other languages too. Ideal for larger projects or projects that require multiple languages. 
* **Virtual Environments:** More lightweight and Python-specific. Simpler and work better for smaller Python-only projects when we don't need to manage non-Python dependencies.

Conda vs Containers
-------------------
* **Conda:** Best for managing environments and packages in a development environment, especially for data science and machine learning. However, Conda environments are typically not as portable or lightweight as containers.
* **Containers:** Provides a more comprehensive solution by packaging not just dependencies but the entire application along with its environment, including the operating system. They are ideal for deployment and cross-platform consistency.

Containers vs Virtual Environments
----------------------------------
* **Containers:** Fully encapsulated and provide complete isolation, including the operating system, making them ideal for deployment and running applications consistently across different systems.
* **Virtual Environments:** Only isolates Python libraries and does not include system dependencies or the operating system itself. They are lightweight and easy to set up but are not as portable or complete as containers.
