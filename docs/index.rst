Introduction to building AI/ML environments 
===========================================

Intro : 
-------
Proper environment management is crucial in complex projects involving multiple languages, 
libraries, and frameworks. Thankfully, various tools have been created to address this, including Conda, 
Virtual Environments, Containers, and Pip.

Purpose : 
---------
The main purpose of using these tools is to ensure that the dependencies for one project don’t 
interfere with another. This is especially critical in complex AI/ML projects, where multiple libraries, 
frameworks, and languages may be used. The tools provide isolation, which helps avoid conflicts and 
ensures consistency across different development and production environments.
